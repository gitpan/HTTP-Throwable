Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Throwable

0.002 Tues. Feb. 8, 2011
    - normalize *_location attributes to all be
      called location, since that is the name of the
      header
    - any time we allow additional headers to be
      passed in, the attribute is now called
      additional_headers instead of whatever it was
      before (usually cache_headers)
    - change the valid_methods attribute in
      HTTP::Throwable::MethodNotAllowed to be just
      allow (which is what the header is)
        - improved the type check on this as well
    - make the exceptions also function as PSGI apps
        - add to_app method
        - support &{} overload
        - added tests for this
    - overload stringification
        - added tests for this
